Cache
Ranks (higher the rank, it moves to faster medium):

Frequency - MFU
Timestamp - most recently used - 
On ties only - size
Frequency threshold - 500, simulate it using a lower value - config file

Notes:
Reset frequency when you move data
When a file in ssd has a frequency of 0 and has not been used in the near past, move to hdd
Each entry has a flag stating where it is stored currently
Try to keep SSDs fully filled (appropriate data only)
Files can move up by only one rank, i.e., Sc1 (4), St1 (3), Gp2(2), io1 (1)
Down rank - 1 to 3 or 2 to 3 or 3 to 4
Cleanup daemon will generate events if SSD drives are underutilized. Whereas, it will always try to clean up HDDs.

Rough draft of mover daemon
Get up periodically
Query for top 5 most frequently used and move then to proper volume
Make frequency counter 0.

Cleanup draft daemon 
If file is not used for a long time (fixed threshold of 1 day) , move to HDD if file is in SSD, else if frequency is below threshold - 50, move to cold HDD.
If file is not used for very long (2days), irrespective of frequency, move the file to lower rank.

Move when no space in SSD
For each file to be moved,
Get all least used files whose size adds to required size and their frequency is less that the files frequency.
Example: - Move HDD1 top 3 to Sdd1

SDD1	SDD2	HDD1	HDD2

1300	400	900	100
1200	250	800	50
