1. Trickle up and trickle down with change in IOPs
---------------------------------------------------
Testbed:
30 files in the range of 17M to 3.5G in size, spread across volumes,
filling most of IO1 and GP2 in the order of their access counts visible in DB.

Steps:
a) Create a file of size 500M. It is created in default (slower, colder) disk.
Script: scripts/mkfile.sh
b) Record read IOPs using scripts/read_file.sh.
c) Update access count using multiple appends high enough to match the hottest file.
Script: scripts/append_file.sh
d) Tail main.log to notice files trickling up and down to make way for our file to reach the hottest disk.
e) Use tree -h on /mnt directory to verify the same.
f) Record read IOPs and appreciate the difference.

---------------------------------------------------

2. A small file (<5M) should not be moved across disks (to SSDs especially),
as it is likely to be written multiple times (like a config file or a source file.)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testbed:
30 files in the range of 17M to 3.5G in size, spread across volumes,
filling most of IO1 and GP2 in the order of their access counts visible in DB.

Steps:
a) Create a small file of size 4M. It resides in SC1/ST1 disk.
Script: scripts/mkfile.sh
b) Update access count using multiple appends high enough to match the hottest file.
Script: scripts/append_file.sh
c) Wait for sometime to make sure it doesn't move across disks.
d) Optionally, we can can inspect DB entries as well to prove it.

3. TBD
